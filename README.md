# The most important library documentation, on your desk!

Looking up documentation can be jarring when you just want to remember a type
signature or how to glue something together.

Why not have the your most commonly looked up things in one place? Perhaps your
friends will learn some nice tricks, too!

## The PDFs:

Currently all A4 only, patches welcome:

* [Control.Lens](lens.pdf)

## Currently planned cheat sheets:

* Lens (1/2 pages done)
* Pipes (not started)
* Prelude, Foldable, Traversable, Data.List
* IO, Control.Concurrent, Async, IO, Unixy things.

## Contributing

In this early stage, snippets of documentation that you are always looking up
would be really helpful.

Please feel free to open a pull request with the documentation
(attributed to its author), assuming it's released under a
BSD-3-compatible license.
