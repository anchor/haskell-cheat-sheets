# The most important library documentation, on your desk!

Looking up documentation can be jarring when you just want to remember a type
signature or how to glue something together.

Why not have the your most commonly looked up things in one place? Perhaps your
friends will learn some nice tricks, too!

## The PDFs:

Currently all A4 only, patches welcome:

* [Control.Lens](lens.pdf)

## Currently planned cheat sheets:

* Lens (1/2 pages done)
* Pipes (not started)
* Prelude, Foldable, Traversable, Data.List
* IO, Control.Concurrent, Async, IO, Unixy things.

## Contributing

In this early stage, snippets of documentation that you are always looking up
would be really helpful.

Please feel free to open an issue with the documentation, and license of said
docs (BSD-3, please).

bits of their documentation.
