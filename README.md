# The most important library documentation on your desk!

What's the idea? Looking up documentation can be jarring when you just
want to remember a type signature or how to glue something together.

Why not have the your most commonly looked up things in one place? Perhaps your
friends will learn some nice tricks, too!

## The pdfs!

Currently all A4 only, patches welcome:

* [Control.Lens](lens.pdf)

## Currently planned cheat sheets:

* Lens (1/2 pages done)
* Pipes (not started)
* Prelude, Foldable, Traversable, Data.List
* IO, Control.Concurrent, Async, IO, Unixy things.

## Contributing

If you have something that you're constantly looking up and would like to
permanately sit on your desk, either open an issue or a PR with your addition.
